                <h4>Who is this scholarship for?</h4>
                <p>
                  Each year, this endowed scholarship will award one student
                  $1k, qualifying it for "competitive scholarship" status. This
                  means that if you are an out of state or international
                  student, you may receive in-state tuition for that year. For
                  this reason, we highly encourage these demographics to apply.
                  In addition to academic excellence, applicants will be
                  preferred if they have demonstrated engagement with any CS
                  student organization at UTD. Note that the scholarship is
                  awarded by a committee appointed by the Jonsson school, and
                  not ACM UTD or Prof. John Cole (our faculty sponsor). Please
                  do not get in touch with us on questions regarding this
                  scholarship.

                <h4>What inspired the scholarship?</h4>
                <p>
                  Our scholarship wasas inspired by the actions and leadership
                  of Gopal Gupta (CS Dept Head 2009-2020). During this time, the
                  department grew immensely and is now the 3rd largest CS
                  department in the United States. In addition to fostering a
                  culture of undergraduate academic excellence, Dr. Gupta placed
                  a large importance on the role of student organizations within
                  the department and the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and
                  Computer Science more broadly. One graded assignment for all
                  incoming freshmen in CS is that they attend an event outside
                  of class where they must talk to representatives from many CS
                  student organizations. Furthermore, Dr. Gupta encouraged
                  students to listen in on department meetings, provide feedback
                  on programs within the department, and present goals and
                  events to faculty members. Finally, Dr. Gupta initiated
                  efforts to start HackUTD, a university hackathon, which has
                  grown to be one of the largest in the U.S.
