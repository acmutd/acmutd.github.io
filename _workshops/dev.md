Splunk Workshop
In this workshop, we'll go over some basic Splunk commands and then present a few scenarios to work through.

Getting Access to Splunk
For the workshop, you can leverage the live Splunk instances created for the event. If you are follwing this after the workshop, you can go to the Splunk website to install an instance of your own.
